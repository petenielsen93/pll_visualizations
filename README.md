# pll_visualizations
This repository is a gallery of my Tableau visualizations for Premier Lacrosse League data. The data currently in use is from August 15, 2021, prior to the finish of the 2021 season. Once the Championship has been played, and data from the whole season is uploaded to the PLL website, a complete analysis and visualization of the season can begin.

Currently the repository does not feature any visualizations. This was due to an unfortunate loss of data when using the Tableau Public desktop application. However, the raw data files and cleaning file are available. Once the full season data is available, I will recreate the initial visualizations and add them along with new ideas to this page. 

Stay tuned and lax on!
